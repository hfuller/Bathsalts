# Bathsalts

Bathsalts is a really bad Skype bot that I wrote. It's not entirely my fault that it's bad, because Microsoft is hellbent on deprecating the Skype API. I'm basically life-supporting this thing until they pull the plug. Anyway, I figured I'd put the source out there for the curious.

If you just want to test it out, send "hackmiesteralt" a message on Skype that says "!addme" and the bot will send you a friend request. Try "!help" and knock yourself out. You're welcome to add the bot to your own group chats and whatnot, although I'm not sure if it can be added to newer chats (MS seems to have broken this; the bot will never receive messages from those chats... but only sometimes? idk, just try it).

I promise I will note what libraries are used in the bot later, but you can look at the imports if you really want to know.
